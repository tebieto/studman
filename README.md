# STUDMAN - Student Mangement Project

This is a competency exercise project built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I will plugin 3rd party themes where neccessary.

# Best Practices Ignored

I tried to keep everything simple on this project, No test was written, I used default functions and UIs when it's faster and did  very minimal error handling. I did not follow DRY principle, especially with API call functions.
